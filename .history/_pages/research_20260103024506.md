I pursue topics in <strong>astrophysics</strong>. <strong>cosmology</strong>, and <strong>computational physics</strong>. In particular, I investigate the dynamics of gravitational waves within the framework of gravitational lensing and how it can reveal insights to the expansion of the universe. Gravitational waves are among the multi-messenger channels we have that can potentially probe the nature of dark energy, characterize structure formation, and uncover the fundamental physics during the inflationary epoch.
