Hello, Gene here and welcome to this space!

I pursue problems in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics">astrophysics</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology">cosmology</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_physics">computational physics</a>, particularly on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens">gravitational lensing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave">gravitational waves</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy">dark energy</a>, and the application of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">machine learning</a> in these areas. Recently, I also became interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_formation">structure formation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_inflation">cosmic inflation</a> as I further explore early– and late–time cosmologies.

I obtained my Master's degree in Physics (2025) and my Bachelor's in Applied Physics (2023) from the <a href='https://upd.edu.ph'> University of the Philippines Diliman</a>. During my graduate studies, I worked on testing cosmological models with gravitational-wave standard sirens under the supervision of <a href="https://ianvega.wixsite.com/ianvega"> Dr. Ian Vega</a>, in collaboration with <a href="https://reggiebernardo.github.io"> Dr. Reggie Bernardo</a> and <a href="https://www.reinareyes.com/bio"> Dr. Reina Reyes</a>. In my undergraduate, I pursued works on gravitational-wave lensing together with <a href="https://www.reinareyes.com/bio"> Dr. Reina Reyes</a>. 

I will be pursuing PhD studies soon!
